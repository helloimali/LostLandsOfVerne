					<h4>After the Great War and the period of Great Rest, the continent of Verne has finally begun rebuilding. However, there has been no claim to the throne. In The Lost Lands of Verne, You, a traveler from a distant land, have voyaged across the sea and have just landed in Verne’s port. Eager to make a name for yourself in the lost land, you must journey throughout the continent rebuilding its shires, reuniting its kingdoms, collecting powerful items and equipment, and slaying savage beasts to take your place as the new ruler of Verne. But be wary, this opportunity is attracting many zealous warriors just like you, so be prepared to fight your way to the throne! You will travel shire to shire, kingdom to kingdom, gaining favor amongst the people of Verne. Along the way there will be bosses to battles and your fellow opponents to fight.</h4>
				<h4>However, you’ll need more than just what hold in your possession; a quick wit and a quicker tongue will do better than you will know in this quest. The Lost Lands of Verne is an easy game to pick up but it is as complicated as the players can make it. You can think one move ahead or have an eight turn plan in the works. Manage your strategy, defend yourself from other players, and deploy the perfect game winning blows. Good Luck!</h4>

				<h3>On your turn:</h3>
				<h4>On a player’s turn, there is a specific order in which they may move, take specific actions, use items or abilities, or perform private transactions. The order in which these actions can be taken is shown below, and it is imperative that this turn order be followed:</h4>
				<ol>
						<li>You must use any movement modifying items or abilities before your movement roll.</li>
						<li>Roll your movement die (d12 by default, d20 with a mount) and move your token clockwise the number of spaces indicated by the die. </li>
						<li>Depending on the space you land on, follow the procedure described in this rulebook.</li>
						<li>You may trade, barter, sell, auction or discard items, equipment, or shires in your inventory.</li>
						<li>You may cast a spell. You may also be able to use certain spells reactionarily.</li>
						<li>You may use an item. You may also be able to use certain items reactionarily.</li>
						<li>You may now initiate a battle with an opposing player within your range.</li>
						<li>You may take another turn if you rolled the maximum value on your movement die (12)</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Battle!</h3>
				<h4>What makes this boardgame unlike the rest? It is our unique blend of battle scenarios! Players travel through the Lands of Verne not only acquire shires and kingdoms under their name, but have a chance of battling for the possession of other;s lands as well.</h4>

				<h4>When two players occupy the same space, either one of them can initiate a battle. However, battling is not necessary if both players agree to keep the peace. If either player wishes to battle, regardless of the other player's desire to battle, a battle is initiated. Once a battle has been initiated, both players pick one scroll to wager. If a player does not have any scrolls to wager, they must wager the equivalent number of pieces to their opponent’s wagered scroll’s buy price (including structures). If neither player has scrolls to wager, they both wager an equal number of pieces of an agreed upon amount. The player who initiates the battle must be the first one to announce their wager. The other player then announces their wager, and the battle begins. Both players roll a 10-sided die, or d10 at the same time. Both players add the battle bonuses from their equipment to the result of their initial roll to get their final result. The player with the higher roll is deemed the winner claims the losers scroll (or pieces), obtaining the rights to the land which was wagered, including any structures or abilities.</h4>

				<h4>Below is an example of a battle:</h4>
				<ol>
						<li>Player 1 (P1) beings a battle with Player 2 (P2).</li>
						<li>P1 chooses to wager their Hymark scroll, and P2 chooses to wager their Ragos scroll.</li>
						<li>P2 uses the "Vial of Poison" item, reducing his opponent's total battle roll by 2.</li>
						<li>P1 rolls the d10, getting an initial roll of 9. P2 rolls the d10, getting an initial roll of 6.</li>
						<li>P1 is holding a dagger, which adds a battle bonus of +1, so P1 adds 1 to his current roll of 9, resulting in a battle roll of 10. P2 is holding a hammer, which adds a battle bonus of +4, so P2 adds 4 to his current roll of 6, resulting in a battle roll of 10.</li>
						<li>P1 subtracts 2 from his battle roll due to P2 using the Vial of Poison item, resulting in a battle roll of 8.</li>
						<li>P1’s final roll is 8. P2’s final roll is 10. 8 is less than 10, thus P1's final result is lower than P2's, so P2 wins.</li>
						<li>P2 recieves P1's Hymark scroll, and the battle ends.</li>
				</ol>
